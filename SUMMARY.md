# Recipe Instructions Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Recipe Instructions Service, which is responsible for fetching recipe instructions from various sources in a specific priority order:

1. **Scraping from URL** (First Priority)
2. **AI Generation** (Second Priority)
3. **Basic Instructions** (Fallback)

## Key Components

### 1. Recipe Instructions API (`backend/recipe_instructions_api.py`)

- FastAPI application that exposes endpoints for fetching recipe instructions
- Handles requests from the frontend and coordinates the instruction fetching process
- Implements a health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Now configurable via command-line arguments to specify the port

### 2. Recipe Instructions Service (`backend/recipe_instructions_service.py`)

- Contains the core logic for fetching recipe instructions
- Implements the `get_recipe_instructions` function that follows the priority order:
  1. First attempts to scrape instructions from the source URL
  2. If scraping fails, falls back to generating instructions with OpenAI
  3. If AI generation fails, uses basic instructions as a final fallback
- Enhanced with detailed logging to track the instruction fetching process

### 3. Frontend Integration (`frontend/src/services/recipeInstructionsService.ts`)

- Makes requests to the Recipe Instructions API
- Implements retry logic for handling failures
- Displays appropriate messages based on the source of instructions

## Testing

We created a test script (`backend/test_scraping_priority.py`) that verifies:

1. The system correctly prioritizes scraping over AI generation
2. The fallback mechanism works as expected when scraping fails

The test results confirm that:
- When given a valid AllRecipes URL, the system successfully scrapes instructions
- When given a non-existent URL, the system correctly falls back to AI generation

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging throughout the scraping process
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Added source tracking to identify where instructions came from

2. **Port Configuration**:
   - Updated the Recipe Instructions API to accept a port parameter
   - Default port set to 8003 with command-line override capability

3. **Timeout Settings**:
   - Increased timeout settings for HTTP requests during scraping
   - Changed from `total=8, connect=3` to `total=15, connect=5`

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling throughout the instruction fetching process
   - Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios

5. **Testing**:
   - Created a dedicated test script to verify the priority order
   - Implemented tests for both successful scraping and fallback scenarios

## Conclusion

The Recipe Instructions Service now correctly follows the specified priority order for fetching recipe instructions:

1. First attempts to scrape from the source URL
2. Falls back to AI generation if scraping fails
3. Uses basic instructions as a final fallback

This implementation ensures that users get the most accurate instructions possible while maintaining robustness through the fallback mechanisms.
